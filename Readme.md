## Sci-Fi Channels
This is a very simple interface to Channel Pear.

To configure for use with your channels edit the Info.plist with your Channel Pear User ID and Password.  These values can be found at the [Channel Pear API site](https://channelpear.com/api/).

I can't imagine any additional functionality, really, but if you're interested in adding some, feel free to send a Pull Request.
